# Pothole-Detection-Visualization
Android application to detect potholes and visualize them on Google map.

## Why this project ?
**Pothole a Major problem in India**

The road is an important mode of transport in India. India has one of the largest road networks in the world with about 59 lakh km of road length. This road length includes National Highways (NHS), district roads, Expressways, State Highways (SHs), project roads, and PWD roads. In India, road infrastructure is used to transport over 60% of total goods and 85% of total passenger traffic. Pothole death is been increasing in our life because of the presence of heavy traffic and water on roads. Road safety is very low. In all these cities, an excuse for potholes on the road and the poor condition of roads is always set out by the heavy monsoon.

As per latest figures by several state governments, potholes across the country claimed 3,597 lives in 2017, a more than 50 pc rise in the toll last year. In 2016, potholes claimed six lives every day in India

The goal of this repository is to detect potholes using segmentation algorithm in deep learning and then present the count of them on map using different colors through Google Map API. Color ranges might be: 
- Green for 0-5 potholes in 100 meter.

- Orange for 5-15 potholes in 100 meter.

- Red for more than 15 potholes or underconstruction roads in 100 meter.
